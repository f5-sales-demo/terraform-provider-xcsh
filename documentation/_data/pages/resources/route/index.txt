# xcsh_route

Breadcrumbs:

- xcsh_route

Manages route object in a given namespace. Route object is list of route rules. Each rule has match
condition to match incoming requests and actions to take on matching requests in F5 Distributed
Cloud.

## Prerequisites

Install Terraform and the `f5-sales-demo/xcsh` provider. Configure provider authentication and access to the target namespace.

## Minimal configuration

Validated with the exact checked-out provider using `terraform validate`. This does not assert a successful live apply.

```terraform
# Route Resource Example
# Manages route object in a given namespace.

terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  required_providers {
    xcsh = {
      source  = "f5-sales-demo/xcsh"
      version = ">= 0.1.0"
    }
  }
}

# Basic Route configuration
resource "xcsh_route" "example" {
  name      = "example-route"
  namespace = "staging"
}
```

## Root configuration

Required root properties: `name`, `namespace`. Full root flags and choices appear in the property reference.
