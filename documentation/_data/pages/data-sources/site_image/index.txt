Breadcrumbs:

- xcsh_site_image

Resolve the current KVM image using exactly one Site owned by the named SMSv2 configuration. No
caller UID or static fallback is supported. Verify the artifact MD5 before use; image resolution
does not imply successful boot.

## Prerequisites

Install Terraform and the `f5-sales-demo/xcsh` provider. Configure provider authentication and access to the target namespace.

## Minimal configuration

Validated with the exact checked-out provider using `terraform validate`. This does not assert a successful live apply.

```terraform
# SiteImage DataSource Example

terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.14"

  required_providers {
    xcsh = {
      source  = "f5-sales-demo/xcsh"
      version = ">= 0.1.0"
    }
  }
}

data "xcsh_site_image" "example" {
  site_name = "example-value"
}

output "site_image_result" {
  value     = data.xcsh_site_image.example
  sensitive = true
}
```

## Root configuration

Required root properties: `site_name`. Full root flags and choices appear in the property reference.
