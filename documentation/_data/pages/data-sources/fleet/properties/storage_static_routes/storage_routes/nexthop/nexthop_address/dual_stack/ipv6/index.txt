### addr property

Type: `"string"`. Computed.

IPv6 Address in form of string. IPv6 address must be specified as hexadecimal numbers separated by
':' The address can be compacted by suppressing zeros e.g. '2001:db8:0:0:0:0:2:1' becomes
'2001:db8::2:1' or '2001:db8:0:0:0:2:0:0' becomes '2001:db8::2::'.
