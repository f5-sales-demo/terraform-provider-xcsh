Type: `"single"`. Computed.

Outlier detection and ejection is the process of dynamically determining whether some number of
hosts in an upstream cluster are performing unlike the others and removing them from the healthy
load balancing set. Outlier detection is a form of passive health checking. Algorithm 1.

Upstream description:

Outlier detection and ejection is the process of dynamically determining whether some number of
hosts in an upstream cluster are performing unlike the others and removing them from the healthy
load balancing set. Outlier detection is a form of passive health checking.

Algorithm

&#8203;1. A endpoint is determined to be an outlier (based on configured number of consecutive\_5xx
or consecutive\_gateway\_failures) . &#8203;2. If no endpoints have been ejected, loadbalancer will
eject the host immediately. Otherwise, it checks to make sure the number of ejected hosts is below
the allowed threshold (specified via max\_ejection\_percent setting). If the number of ejected hosts
is above the threshold, the host is not ejected. &#8203;3. The endpoint is ejected for some number
of milliseconds. Ejection means that the endpoint is marked unhealthy and will not be used during
load balancing. The number of milliseconds is equal to the base\_ejection\_time value multiplied by
the number of times the host has been ejected. &#8203;4. An ejected endpoint will automatically be
brought back into service after the ejection time has been satisfied.

## Direct properties

<a id="schema-outlier_detection--base_ejection_time"></a>

### base_ejection_time property

Type: `"number"`. Computed.

The base time that a host is ejected for. The real time is equal to the base time multiplied by the
number of times the host has been ejected. This causes hosts to GET ejected for longer periods if
they continue to fail.

Upstream description:

The base time that a host is ejected for. The real time is equal to the base time multiplied by the
number of times the host has been ejected. This causes hosts to GET ejected for longer periods if
they continue to fail. Defaults to 30000ms or 30s. Specified in milliseconds.

<a id="schema-outlier_detection--consecutive_5xx"></a>

### consecutive_5xx property

Type: `"number"`. Computed.

If an upstream endpoint returns some number of consecutive 5xx, it will be ejected. Note that in
this case a 5xx means an actual 5xx respond code, or an event that would cause the HTTP router to
return one on the upstream’s behalf(reset, connection failure, etc.) consecutive\_5xx indicates
the..

Upstream description:

If an upstream endpoint returns some number of consecutive 5xx, it will be ejected. Note that in
this case a 5xx means an actual 5xx respond code, or an event that would cause the HTTP router to
return one on the upstream’s behalf(reset, connection failure, etc.) consecutive\_5xx indicates the
number of consecutive 5xx responses required before a consecutive 5xx ejection occurs. Defaults to
5.

<a id="schema-outlier_detection--consecutive_gateway_failure"></a>

### consecutive_gateway_failure property

Type: `"number"`. Computed.

If an upstream endpoint returns some number of consecutive “gateway errors” (502, 503 or 504 status
code), it will be ejected. Note that this includes events that would cause the HTTP router to return
one of these status codes on the upstream’s behalf (reset, connection failure, etc.)..

code), it will be ejected. Note that this includes events that would cause the HTTP router to return

Consecutive\_gateway\_failure indicates the number of consecutive gateway failures before a
consecutive gateway failure ejection occurs. Defaults to 5.
