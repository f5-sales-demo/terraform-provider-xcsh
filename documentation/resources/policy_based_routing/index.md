# xcsh_policy_based_routing

Breadcrumbs:

- xcsh_policy_based_routing

Manages a Policy Based Routing resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for network policy based routing
create specification. configuration.

## Prerequisites

Install Terraform and the `f5-sales-demo/xcsh` provider. Configure provider authentication and access to the target namespace.

## Minimal configuration

Validated with the exact checked-out provider using `terraform validate`. This does not assert a successful live apply.

```terraform
# PolicyBasedRouting Resource Example
# Manages a Policy Based Routing resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for network policy based routing create specification.

terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  required_providers {
    xcsh = {
      source  = "f5-sales-demo/xcsh"
      version = ">= 0.1.0"
    }
  }
}

# Basic PolicyBasedRouting configuration
resource "xcsh_policy_based_routing" "example" {
  name      = "example-policy-based-routing"
  namespace = "staging"
}
```

## Root configuration

Required root properties: `name`, `namespace`. Full root flags and choices appear in the property reference.
