Breadcrumbs:

- xcsh_fast_acl

Manages object, object contains rules to protect site from denial of service It has
destination\{destination IP, destination port) and references to in F5 Distributed Cloud.

## Prerequisites

Install Terraform and the `f5-sales-demo/xcsh` provider. Configure provider authentication and access to the target namespace.

## Minimal configuration

Validated with the exact checked-out provider using `terraform validate`. This does not assert a successful live apply.

```terraform
# FastACL Resource Example
# Manages object, object contains rules to protect site from denial of service It has destination{destination IP, destination port) and references to in F5 Distributed Cloud.

terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  required_providers {
    xcsh = {
      source  = "f5-sales-demo/xcsh"
      version = ">= 0.1.0"
    }
  }
}

# Basic FastACL configuration
resource "xcsh_fast_acl" "example" {
  name      = "example-fast-acl"
  namespace = "system"
}
```

## Root configuration

Required root properties: `name`. Full root flags and choices appear in the property reference.
